          <h2>oXygen XML Editor framework for NISO JATS 1.0, adapted for Atypon’s Literatum platform</h2>
          <p>NISO JATS Z39.96-2012 defines an XML-based format for the authoring,
          publication and archiving of journal articles and related information.
          Its design is based on the NLM Journal Archiving and Publishing DTDs
          through version 3.0.</p>
          <p>For submission to its Literatum content delivery platform, Atypon requires
          some additional conventions to be observed. Most of them will be checked by Schematron
          rules.</p>
          <p>Adaption of Wendell Piez’s original JATS framework was commissioned by 
          Hogrefe Verlag, Göttingen, and was carried out by Gerrit Imsieke of le-tex publishing services.</p>
          <p>Some Schematron rules in literatum_JATS.sch are specific to Hogrefe’s production or
          articles in the field of psychology. There is currently no other customization mechanism
          than to fork the project and build a customized framework.</p>
