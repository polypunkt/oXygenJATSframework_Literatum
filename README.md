oXygenJATSframework
===================

oXygen XML Editor framework for NISO JATS 1.0 / NLM BITS

Atypon Literatum / Hogrefe version 0.6 with Schematron checks and Literatum
package building. Use https://hobots.hogrefe.com/oXygenJATSframework_Literatum/oXygenJATSframework_Literatum.xml as the package installation URL in oXygen.



NISO JATS Z39.96-2012 defines an XML-based format for the authoring,
publication and archiving of journal articles and related information.
Its design is based on the NLM Journal Archiving and Publishing DTDs
through version 3.0.

This oXygen framework supports editing JATS articles along with books
conformant to the specifications of BITS 0.2, the JATS-based NLM book
tag set (in draft, November 2012). Included are DTDs optimized with
documentation for display in oXygen, CSS files for authoring, document
templates, and XSLT stylesheets for production of HTML and PDF
(preview) outputs.

See the project wiki at https://github.com/wendellpiez/oXygenJATSframework/wiki
for installation instructions.
